## Goals of Project

The goal of this project was to practice using Ruby's File class, serialization, and object oriented programming principles.

## What I Learned

This project provided excellent practice using Ruby's File class. I obtained a premade text file (https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english) and then used it to create a new file containing only those words between 5 and 12 characters.
Moreover, the project provided excellent practice with serialization and deserialization. I used YAML serialization to allow players to save the game; deserialization was used upon loading a saved game.

In addition, the project provided additional practice using object-oriented-programming principles.

## Next Steps

Next steps will include refactoring and making the code more readable and organized.
